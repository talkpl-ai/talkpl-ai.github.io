All we love we leave behind...\"\n\nOur awful derated state feels like a deathless march of distress\nScraping through this tales was a hazard, so let's taste the void\nI saw it all, from heartbreaking delight to crippling pain\nThat's why we left it all behind, you, me and the violence\n\nAt least you won't dry this river and home's just a place for the heartless\nNo dear friends at all, just strangers with faded but versant faces\nThe future's so scary, but you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar!\nYes, it's tempting... ...but it's a mistake!\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nThese long roads apart seem like a promising shelter\nA home away from \"home\", with a beautiful fierce and a fabulous strut\nSequel we go on declaring war on nostalgia, hours of remembrance\nWe burn all the nice pictures and do the ashes like coke!\nAll the footsteps we've ever left, and the one's that will follow\nAre set for just one reason, someday you'll understand\nWe take step by step just not to stall, but when it's over\nSteal me away and deliver my bones to the sea!",

The main tune is being played by the distorted electric guitar while the bass guitar is playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by a loud acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is rebellious and aggressive. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a gruesome horror video game."
