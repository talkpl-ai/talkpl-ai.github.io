  "predict_response": "Great choice! Here's another fun one from \"Weird Al\" Yankovic: **\"Party In the CIA\"**. It's a hilarious parody of Miley Cyrus's \"Party In The U.S.A.\" with clever lyrics about espionage and spy life. This track has that signature Weird Al comedy style with a catchy pop-rock sound that I think you'll really enjoy!\n\nLet me know if you want to hear more parodies or if you'd like to explore something different! ðŸŽµ",
  "predict_response_cot": "<think>\nOkay, the user just asked for another track by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic after I played \"White & Nerdy\". Let me check the previous interactions to make sure I'm consistent.\n\nIn the previous turn, I played \"White & Nerdy\" which the user requested directly. Now they want another Weird Al track. Looking at the retrieval results, I have several Weird Al parodies to choose from.\n\n\"Party In The CIA\" is a great option - it's a parody of Miley Cyrus's \"Party In The U.S.A.\" The track has comedy and parody tags, which aligns with what the user enjoyed in \"White & Nerdy\". The tags include novelty, satire, comedy, funny, and catchy - all good indicators that this fits the user's taste.\n\nThe user is a 10s male from Morocco with a preference for Anglo-American music. \"Party In The CIA\" is from 2011 (tagged as 2010s, 10s) which fits the user's age group. It's a pop-rock comedy track with clever lyrics about espionage, maintaining that signature Weird Al humor style.\n\nThis track is similar enough to \"White & Nerdy\" in terms of genre (both are parodies with catchy pop elements) but different enough in subject matter (nerdy culture vs. CIA spy life) to provide variety. The audio and image paths are available, so the user can listen and see the album art.\n\nI should present this recommendation enthusiastically, explaining why it's a good match - the parody style, the comedy elements, and the catchy nature. I'll also invite the user to continue exploring or try something different.\n</think>",
  "predict_tool_cot": "<think>\nOkay, the user just asked for another track by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic after listening to \"White & Nerdy\" and \"Party In the CIA\". Let me check the previous interactions to understand the context.\n\nIn the initial query, the user had a history of listening to several tracks by Weird Al, including \"Party in the CIA\", \"Canadian Idiot\", \"Tacky\", \"CNR\", and \"Word Crimes\". The user is in the 'warm_start' user type, so I should use user_to_item_similarity for reranking. \n\nThe task is to recommend another track by Weird Al. The user has already listened to some of his parodies, so the next track should be another parody or similar style. Since the user is in the 10s age group and male, the recommendations should match that demographic.\n\nFor retrieval, using BM25 with the 'artist' corpus type makes sense because the user is looking for tracks by a specific artist. Then, for reranking, using user_to_item_similarity with the user_id would personalize the recommendations based on their previous interactions with Weird Al.\n\nI need to make sure the SQL query for retrieval includes tracks by Weird Al, and then use the user similarity to refine the results. The topk for both stages should be 20, as per the requirements. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly.\n</think>"
