It\u2019s got that same raw, narrative-driven vibe, exploring themes of heartbreak and self-discovery. If you want more along these lines, I can also suggest tracks from artists like Kendrick Lamar, J.

  "predict_response_cot": "<think>\nOkay, the user really likes Mac Miller's \"Planet God Damn\" for its deep, introspective storytelling. They want more similar tracks, either by Mac Miller or other artists with a similar vibe.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available tracks. The next recommendation is \"Cinderella\" by Mac Miller. It's from the same album, so it's a good fit. The track has a sad tone and introspective lyrics, which matches the user's preference.\n\nBut maybe the user would also appreciate other artists. I should think of other hip-hop artists known for storytelling and introspective lyrics. Artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, or even Tyler, the Creator come to mind. However, the system only provides the next track, so I should focus on that.\n\nThe user mentioned \"artists with a similar introspective, storytelling vibe,\" so I should highlight that \"Cinderella\" continues the theme. Also, mention that if they want more, I can suggest others. Need to keep the response positive and encouraging, making sure to connect the new track to their preferences.\n</think>",
  "predict_tool_cot": "<think>\nOkay, the user is really into hip-hop tracks with deep lyrical storytelling, especially those that explore complex relationships and introspective themes. They've already been given recommendations from Masta Ace and Phora, and now they're asking for more, specifically mentioning Mac Miller and similar artists.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the tools available. The user is in a \"warm_start\" category, so for reranking, I should prioritize user_to_item_similarity. But since they're asking for more recommendations, I should use retrieval and reranking tools. \n\nThe user has a history of listening to tracks by Masta Ace and Phora, so maybe using item_to_item_similarity with their previous tracks could help find similar songs. Alternatively, using semantic_id_matching with the metadata or lyrics might be effective. \n\nLooking at the previous interactions, the user has been given tracks with specific semantic IDs. The last track provided was \"Planet God Damn\" by Mac Miller. So, using item_to_item_similarity with the track_id of \"Planet God Damn\" and modality_type as \"cf_item\" might retrieve similar tracks. \n\nAlternatively, using the user_to_item_similarity with the user_id 63883 and topk=20 could help find tracks that the user might like based on their history. But since the user is asking for similar artists or tracks, maybe item_to_item is better. \n\nWait, the user is asking for more tracks like Mac Miller or similar artists. So, using item_to_item_similarity with the track_id of \"Planet God Damn\" and modality_type as \"cf_item\" (since it's a track similarity) would get similar tracks. Then, reranking with user_to_item_similarity to personalize it. \n\nBut the user is in warm_start, so reranking should use user_to_item_similarity. However, the user hasn't listened to many tracks yet, but they have a history. So, combining retrieval and reranking with the user's past interactions. \n\nAlternatively, using semantic_id_matching with the metadata or lyrics to find tracks with similar themes. But since the user has specific tags like \"hip-hop/rap\", \"lyrics\", \"attributes\", maybe using semantic_id_matching with modality_type as \"lyrics\" and indices from the previous tracks. \n\nBut the previous tracks have specific semantic IDs. For example, \"Planet God Damn\" has attributes:semantic_id [43, 23, 32, 29]. So, using semantic_id_matching with modality_type as \"attributes\" and indices [43, 23, 32, 29] could find similar tracks. \n\nAlternatively, using BM25 with a query about \"complex relationships\" in the lyrics corpus. But the user is looking for similar tracks, so item_to_item or semantic_id_matching might be better. \n\nConsidering the tools, the best approach would be to first retrieve similar tracks using item_to_item_similarity with the last track's ID, then rerank using user_to_item_similarity. \n\nSo, first, call item_to_item_similarity with track_id:7bd0BC9RNR6GxJsM3pRwBw (Planet God Damn), modality_type:cf, corpus_type:cf. Then, rerank with user_to_item_similarity for user 63883, topk=20. \n\nBut need to check if the tools are complementary. Item_to_item is for retrieval, user_to_item for reranking. Since the user is warm_start, reranking uses user_to_item. \n\nSo, the first step is to retrieve similar tracks using item_to_item_similarity, then rerank with user_to_item. That should give personalized recommendations based on the user's history and similar tracks.\n</think>"
