  "predict_response_cot": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for a must-hear Ghostface Killah solo track from the mid-to-late 90s.

Ghostface Killah)\" by Ghostface Killah and Raekwon from the album \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\" released in 1995. But wait, the user specifically wants a solo track by Ghostface Killah. The track here features Raekwon, so it's not a solo track.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another track. Let me think. Ghostface Killah has several solo tracks from that era. \"Crack Rock\" from 1996 is a classic. But the data provided doesn't include that. The available track is \"Criminology,\" which is a collaboration. Since the user is looking for a solo track, I need to clarify that the recommended track isn't solo. I should apologize and suggest an alternative. Maybe mention \"Crack Rock\" as a must-hear solo track and explain why it's a good fit. Also, invite the user to explore more if they want.\n</think>",
  "predict_tool_cot": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for a must-hear Ghostface Killah solo track from the mid-to-late 90s. They've already been discussing Wu-Tang Clan tracks and solo joints from that era.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Ghostface Killah's solo work from the 90s. \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\" is his debut album from 1995, so that's a good starting point. The user mentioned \"mid-to-late 90s,\" so maybe tracks from that album or others around that time.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the user is in a cold_start phase, so I can't use user_to_item_similarity. The retrieval tool should be something that can find tracks based on metadata or keywords. BM25 is good for lexical matches, but maybe text_to_item_similarity is better for semantic queries. However, since the user is asking for a specific solo track, maybe using the SQL tool to query tracks with Ghostface Killah as the artist and from the 90s.\n\nWait, the user wants a solo track, so the artist should be Ghostface Killah. Also, the release date should be between mid-90s. The SQL function can filter by artist and release date. Let me check the SQL schema. The release_date is a datetime, so I can use that. Also, the track should be from the 90s, so release_date between 1990-01-01 and 1999-12-31.\n\nBut the user is asking for a specific track. Maybe the tool can return a list of tracks by Ghostface Killah from that era, and then the reranking can prioritize based on popularity or other factors. However, the reranking tool for cold_start users can't use user_to_item_similarity. So maybe use item_to_item_similarity or another tool.\n\nWait, the reranking stage should use the same topk as retrieval. Let's say we retrieve 20 tracks, then rerank them. But for cold_start, we can't use user_to_item_similarity. So maybe use item_to_item_similarity with a track_id from the retrieval results. But the user hasn't provided a specific track_id yet. Alternatively, use the text_to_item_similarity with a query for \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as metadata.\n\nAlternatively, use BM25 with the query \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as artist. But the user is looking for solo tracks, so the artist should be Ghostface Killah, and the track should not be part of a group project. However, the SQL tool can filter by artist and release date. Let me structure the SQL query to get tracks by Ghostface Killah where release_date is in the 90s. Then, use the same topk for reranking. For reranking, maybe use item_to_item_similarity with the top track from retrieval. But the user wants at least 20 tracks, so maybe the retrieval stage uses SQL to get 20 tracks, then rerank them using another tool.\n\nBut the user is asking for a specific solo track. Maybe the first step is to retrieve tracks by Ghostface Killah from the 90s, then rerank them based on popularity or other factors. However, since the user is in cold_start, the reranking can't use user_to_item_similarity. So the reranking tool could be item_to_item_similarity or text_to_item_similarity.\n\nAlternatively, use BM25 for retrieval and then rerank with another tool. Let me check the tools again. The user is in cold_start, so reranking can't use user_to_item_similarity. So the reranking tool could be item_to_item_similarity or text_to_item_similarity. For the retrieval, maybe BM25 with query \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as artist. Then, rerank with item_to_item_similarity using the top track from retrieval.\n\nBut the user wants at least 20 tracks. So the retrieval stage would need to return 20 tracks, then rerank them. However, the reranking tool might not have enough data. Alternatively, use SQL to get 20 tracks by Ghostface Killah from the 90s, then rerank them using another tool. But the reranking tool for cold_start can't use user_to_item_similarity. So maybe use text_to_item_similarity with the query \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as metadata.\n\nWait, the user is asking for a must-hear track, so maybe the first step is to retrieve the most popular or highly rated tracks by Ghostface Killah from the 90s. The SQL tool can filter by artist and release date, then sort by popularity. But the SQL function requires a query that returns track_ids. So the SQL query would be SELECT track_id FROM tracks WHERE artist = 'Ghostface Killah' AND release_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1999-12-31' ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 20. Then, for reranking, use item_to_item_similarity with the top track from retrieval, but that might not give 20. Alternatively, use text_to_item_similarity with a query for \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as metadata.\n\nAlternatively, use BM25 with the query \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as artist. Then, rerank with another tool. But the reranking tool for cold_start can't use user_to_item_similarity, so maybe use text_to_item_similarity. But the user is in cold_start, so the reranking can't use user_to_item_similarity. So the reranking tool could be text_to_item_similarity.\n\nPutting it all together, the retrieval stage would use BM25 with query \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\" and corpus_type as artist, topk=20. Then, reranking with text_to_item_similarity with the same query and corpus_type as metadata, topk=20. But I need to make sure that the tools are complementary and no overlap. BM25 is for lexical matching, and text_to_item_similarity is for semantic matching. That's complementary.\n\nSo the first tool call is BM25 with query \"Ghostface Killah solo 90s\", corpus_type \"artist\", topk=20. Then, reranking with text_to_item_similarity using the same query and corpus_type \"metadata\", topk=20. However, the user is in cold_start, so the reranking can't use user_to_item_similarity, but text_to_item_similarity is allowed. That should work.\n</think>"
